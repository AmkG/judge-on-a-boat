Judge on a Boat


Prologue

Falling, falling, falling, that was what was happening,
of course falling was what a planetary drop pod was
for but this was the bad falling, the kind which could
kill you, and her brain - a primitive simian derivative
that processed "falling" extremely well, falling being
a work-related risk for swinging around on trees - was
putting out distress codes, feeding nasty hormones into
her bloodstream, which really necessitated triggering
her deep rationality training, but she didn't really
remember to do that part.

But she survived, and in the end, that was what a brain
was for.

Rationality was for winning.  And perhaps in retrospect
the flight-or-fight response had been the right thing to
do, at least she survived...

Although in retrospect, maybe she should have forked over
the added price for the safer space elevator.


Chapter 1

Emmanuel Verrens woke with a start when Judge David Adams'
receptionist spoke his name, indicating that his meeting
with the august Fifth-rank Lord Judge was to start.

Emmanuel Verrens was a young Judge, of the interplanetary
order of Judges.  As yet unranked, his status newly minted
with his recent examination.

He had been summoned for a meeting, topic unspecified except
for a vague "regarding your examination and recent promotion
to unranked Judge", and his rationality training suggested
that this summons, so recently after his examination and
promotion, was not good.  It was less good, too, that now
he had arrived at the appointed time, he had been asked to
wait, and was still waiting almost an hour later.

Still, there was insufficient evidence that it was something
specifically to fear, and so Verrens had
clamped down on his misgivings, invoking some of the
standard rationality forms developed against fear.  Don't
fear failure.  Mantras to be repeated as a background thought
loop, to keep the fear at bay, deeply ingrained training that
was easy to maintain.  Special thought processes designed
and refined to keep himself sane against fear.  It was easy,
the little fear was no big deal, and thus Verrens was quite
sane, even as his appointed time came and went, and he was
still in the waiting room.

He'd even managed to nap a little, out of sheer boredom, that
was how little the fear got through his trained defenses
against it.

Verrens got up, nodded, and entered the office of Judge
David Adams.


Chapter 2

Nicole Angel awoke to a blissful, swaying feeling, found her
hand clutched tight to some rubber, or probably synthetic
plastic, and saw the ocean surrounding her.

Memory came flooding back.

She had been on the way to her standardized Judgment Acceptance
examination, back on Old Earth, from her birthplace at Mars
Lagrange 1.  The trip was costly, involving an actual drop into and
(of course) liftoff from a planetary gravity well, and Earth was
still the heaviest gravity well inhabited by humans, and was
still the cultural center of Humanity, which meant that the trip
was quite expensive.

But passing the standard test and becoming a Judge was supposed
to be worth that, and more.

She'd crammed - rationality senseis clucked at students who did
so, but that attractor state (defer things later! You Ain't Gonna
Need It!) still attracted human beings like flies to honey, or
more likely vinegar, but as irrationalities went cramming was a
just a slight inefficiency, so rationality senseis just clucked
at it - and of course like many she even dipped a little into
the Dark Arts, using rote memorization instead of actual
understanding.  Then she kissed her family goodbye, promising to
come back a fully-fledged Judge Of No Rank.

The actual trip through space was uneventful - her seat companion
was a young female Engineer, sponsored by her home company for
training at Earth, and somewhere nearby, Nicole had noticed,
had been a somewhat attractive young male whose bearing suggested
"Executor", with whom Nicole had kept slight eye contact a few
seconds more than strictly uninterested strangerness warranted.

Then came the failed drop, and now this, floating somehow on an
inflatable raft with two strangers and a slightly-more-familiar
acquaintance, her Engineer seat companion of the company Earth
training trip.

No, make that two strangers, her Engineer acquaintance, and that
somewhat attractive maybe Executor with whom Nicole had maybe
flirted, hanging off the other side of the raft, his chest and
head inside, but his lower torso and legs dipped into the ocean.

A total of five people.

The Engineer tapped her shoulder, and then whispered, "Judge,
we have a problem.  This raft's capacity is four people."


Chapter 3

"Good Afternoon, Judge Adams," he said.

"Good Afternoon.  Have a seat," answered Adams.

It wasn't a personal office, as it turned out.  Or if it was,
then it was a rather strange one.  Had Verrens been asked his
opinion, it was actually a meeting room, with a long table,
several chairs, a whiteboard, and a screen.

Judge David Adams, of Fifth Rank, sat near one end, with several
printed papers lying spread out in front of him.  Adams was
indicating a seat just across his, so Verrens sat into it.
There was silence for a moment, and then -

"Here," said Adams, handing over a few papers, "is a manuscript -
ostensibly of a novel - regarding a Judge, or rather, an aspiring
Judge trainee.  As you yourself was, just recently, prior to
your own examination here on Earth.  Think of it as an informal
final examination for yourself."

Verrens took the papers.  Was Adams pulling rank and trying to
make him some kind of early proofreader for his own novel?

It started, "Falling, falling, falling, that was what was
happening, of course falling was what a planetary drop pod
was for but this was the bad falling..."

Verrens asked, "Judge, what is this for?"

"It's being proposed as a form of training, and potentially
testing, for student Judges.  Informally, you are here since,
until recently, you were a student Judge, and thus we would
value your input about this manuscript," said Adams.

"I see," said Verrens, ruffling some pages.  "Out of
curiousity, is this based on, say, a true story?"

"You could say that," said Adams.  "So true, in fact, that
we can even trace the thoughts of the main character."

"Ah," was all Verrens could say.

He read for a moment.

"Ah," said Adams, "I see you have had speed reader training,
Judge.  That is fortunate.  Perhaps we can complete our
analysis of this novel in one sitting."

"Yes, Judge," said Verrens.  "I studied it fully.  Speed
up saccades, eliminate subvocalization, lengthen
fixations, and practice, practice, practice..."

"That's good," answered Adams.  "I myself am just starting
speed reading training.  And just in time too, since I
must read many more of these novels, of various authorships
and variations in version.  And interview many different
new Judges like yourself, in order to gain different views
on the novel."


Chapter 4

"I'm not a Judge!" Nicole whispered back urgently.  "I'm
just a candidate for -"

"Well, you're the nearest thing to a Judge we have right
now," the Engineer answered back just as urgently.  "I
asked.  The other woman is a Medic, the man in the boat
is an accountant, and the man hanging onto our boat for
dear life is an Executor.  You're the nearest to a Judge
we have right now.  So.  I'm asking you, formally, for a
Judgment, on a matter of life and death.  How should we
choose who to kick off this boat, Judge?  There's five of
us, the boat holds four, and -"

"Can't this boat really hold five?  Especially with one of
those five being technically outside the boat anyway?"
There were safety margins, weren't there?  Surely an
Engineer would know that -

"Normally it can," said the Engineer.  "That's why I
pulled the Executor close.  I couldn't pull him all the
way in, I'm not physically strong enough, especially
last night, and he's a heavy guy.  But the boat seems
to have a slow leak -"

"All right, how about if we all do what the Executor
is doing?  Hang off the side of the boat?"

The Engineer paused.

"Plausible," she said.  "But Judge, consider - currently
with only one extra passenger hanging off the side of
the boat, we're already experiencing a slow leak.  We
could all hang off the side of the boat, but what if
that doesn't stop the leaking?  That's highly likely,
too.  If we're not rescued soon, we may have to sacrifice
one of us so that the raft doesn't sink completely.  It's
a metal lined rubber craft, so below a certain air
pressure in the bladder it will sink.  Now I'm asking
you, formally, for a Judgment, on a matter of life and
death.  In the future, we may need to kick off one of our
number.  How should we choose who to kick off this boat,
Judge?  Let this be a precommitment to a method, specified
by a Judge, that binds us all."

But Nicole wasn't a Judge.

It didn't even matter that she hadn't passed, or even
taken, the Judge Acceptance Exam.  She knew she had the
knowledge and the training, and if she had taken it, the
chances were good that she would pass and be promoted to
an unranked Judge.

But passing a test did not make you a Judge, not really.

It was rather the community and culture of the Judges
that defined your identity as a Judge.

Oh, the test was thorough.  Written exams, and even
scanning of your brain's morality cores, at least those
already identified by Neurology Scientists.  Practice
mock tests, even - the Sociology Scientists were paid
handsomely to think up of new tests each year that
would look innocuous to even the most high-strung
Judge examinee, but which would reveal the inner
workings of their morality cores almost as well as, or
(it was reputed) even better than the Neurologist's
best scans.

And once you passed, the eyes of every other living
Judge were upon you and every moral decision over
which you passed Judgment...

Cameras were ubiquitous all over Humanity's inhabited
areas.  By law, all cameras were to be marked and
readily visible as such, and all were accessible to
the public.  Spy cameras, unmarked and hidden, or
accessible only to certain groups or individuals,
were highly illegal and always searched for by the
Hackers; the Sousveillance Law that banned hidden
cameras and required public access was the only
existing law that crossed geopolitical boundaries,
and the only one allowed to mention the death
penalty as a possible punishment.

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?  Why, every watcher
was watched by fellow watchers, and every person
capable of minimum reason - and this category was
very broad indeed - was a watcher.

And every Judge was judged by every other Judge.

A Judge gained rank by a Formal Challenge of
another Judge's Judgment.  Such a Formal
Challenge of Judgment was an assertion that the
Judgment had been faulty.  Records of the decision,
as well as the particular details of the issue to
be decided, were often available from the
ubiquitous cameras all over inhabited space.

And once such a case was brought to light, Judges
all over Humanity's domain were invited to vote
on whether to strip a rank from challenger, or
from the challenged.  The stripped rank would be
awarded to the other.

A Judge of No Rank would lose his or her vocation,
if he or she lost a Formal Challenge of Judgment.
Slightly more than half the Judges in existence at
any one time would be of No Rank.  The other
remaining half were composed almost entirely of
First Rank.  A very few achieved higher ranks.

Rank was a score, but by law Judges were paid
based on age and typical living expenses in their
registered living area.  But a higher rank still
meant that you had a safety margin, in case of an
error in Judgment.

And without that community of Judges watching over
your shoulder, you couldn't be a Judge, not
really.  With the respect accorded to Judges in
Humanity's culture, and the built-in selfishness
circuits of your simian-derived brain, you could
only be a tyrant.  The existence of watching
peers balanced out against both forces.

There were no cameras on the boat.  So, barring
illegal unmarked cameras, no one could ever see
the details of Nicole's Judgment.


Chapter 5

Emmanuel Verrens paused.

If the novel was about true events - how had they
known about Nicole, without any cameras having
seen it?

"Judge Adams?"

"Yes, Judge Verrens?" Adams asked.

"Judge, if there were no cameras on the boat,
and this novel is non-fictional -"

"Well, I didn't really say the novel is
non-fictional, or even say that it was based
on true events.  I did say, that you could say
it was based on true events, but really, the
truth of these events is a bit hazy, as you
should recognize from the lack of cameras."

"Ah," said Verrens, "I see, Judge."

"Do you?  Good," said Adams.  He smiled.
"In any case, suffice it to say that nothing
illegal was involved in the writing of this
novel.  Rather, I wish you to focus on the
moral dilemmas that the protagonist is facing.
What exactly are they, at this point?"

Verrens considered for a while, skimming
through the earlier pages before he had
inserted his finger.

"Well, there's the obvious one asked of her -
the method by which to select one of their
number to kick off the boat.  The fact that
she is being asked to make a Judgment, even
though she is not yet a Judge -"

"That one is trivially dismissable, I would
say, Judge?" said Adams, interrupting Verrens.

"True," Verrens said.  "She has the training,
and the confidence in her skill to act as a
full Judge, despite not having taken the
test yet.  As I was about to mention, anyway.
Not really a moral dilemma, then, although I
included it for completeness.  She can indeed
act as a full Judge - awareness of one's
knowledge and level of skill is a requirement
in our vocation.  And the final dilemma -"

Adams looked at him expectantly.

"The lack of peer oversight," Verrens said,
"set against the necessity of providing
Judgment, in a condition where such Judgment is
likely to be necessary, and likely to be a
matter of life and death."

Adams continued to look at him expectantly.

"I'm sorry, Judge, those are all the dilemmas
I can see right now," Verrens said.

Adams nodded.  "Judge, both you and Nicole
Angel failed to see another moral dilemma,
at this point."  He paused.  "She did not
consider investigating for herself whether
what the Engineer told her was true, versus
her personal embarrasment, should it indeed
turn out to be true.  A common logical
failing that afflicts even the best of us,
and as I recall, three of my successful
Formal Challenges."

Verrens considered this.  "But Judge, the
exposition of the Engineer -"

"- was not sufficient evidence of its truth
in this case, even as an expert statement.
The veracity of the matter can be checked
explicitly and does not require an export's
exposition.  Of course, I must admit that it
would be so, in a typical novel; a writer
preserves detail, so as not to overburden
the reader with possible red herrings.  But
in the world, the real
world, a Judge in such a position must
demand the investigation; must at least do
so as background to his or her task."

Verrens nodded.  "And if this is, as you say,
true in a way - then perhaps that is a true
moral failing of Nicole Angel."

"One she would do well to protect herself
against, in her future career.  Of course,
the novel has yet to reveal whether that will
happen, or even possible to happen, or -"


Chapter 6

Nicole watched as the Engineer - now known as
Julia Montega - called the others - Raphael
Yu the accountant, Ekaterina "Katja" Ivanova
the Medic, and Michael Thompson the Executor -
to a meeting in order for her to pass
Judgment.

"The standard solution to this," Nicole said
once Julia had explained their problem, "is
to draw lots.  A random choice, which
distributes the penalty across all of us."

"How about -" Michael started, then swallowed
to wet his throat.  "How about I just swim
off?  I'm the one who got added here... it's
not fair to the rest of you..."

"I'm the Judge," Nicole said.  "That's my
Judgment."

"And you are not likely to survive long
without the boat," Katja said.  "Unless we
all manage to get rescued in an hour or
so.  Even though the waters are relatively
warm - we're probably in tropical waters -
treading the water will exhaust you."  She
paused.  "You do have a life vest, but
another night of exposure may be too much.
So, let me revise my earlier estimate.
Unless we manage to get rescued before
nightfall, you yourself must be replaced
in the water."

"Yes," Julia the Engineer said, "we can't
really afford to lose any of us here.
We're all useful.  Oh.  I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have said that."  She was
looking at Raphael the accountant.  "I'm
a demisavant, I'm no good at social
relationships..." She trailed off.

Nicole was stunned into silence.  Trust a
demisavant to see that as obvious, and then
blow it by making the faux pas of saying it
as if it were obvious.

A Medic was most obviously useful in their
situation.  An Engineer would likely be
useful, to figure out how to make simple
machinery, fix whatever complex machines
they might have access to, to help them
and the Medic in her work.  A demisavant
at that; more useful at simple non-social
problems (which more likely to occur
here, there were only five of them) than
complex social exchanges.  A Judge to
consider policy decisions, an Executor to
enforce them - what indeed could Raphael
offer them?

Nicole shuddered.

It was precisely this that the community
of Judges was for.

No one could be left behind, not even in
the name of "the greater good."

No matter how "useless" someone might
appear to be.  Civilization would not
allow it.

And in practice, in a complex scientific
civilization, no one was really useless...

A person's vocation only indicated his or
her main interest, decided at a time in their
life when he or she was just barely mature.
Side interests were sometimes much more
powerfully attractive to a person, after a
while.

And those side interests could spell the
difference between life and death.
Civilization's commitment to helping
everyone was based on that observation -
that an eager amateur hero already on-site
could do as well as, or even better, than a
bored expert who arrived too late to do
anything.  Eleven billion individuals on
Earth, and the billion or so on the Lagrange
points of various other planets in the solar
system, and the half billion on Mars, depended
too much on complex machinery - physical
machinery, as well as social machinery such as
democracy, sousveillance, markets, disputation
arenas, the Judgment System, peer review.
Complex machines that some individuals found
obsessively compelling to study in an amateur
fashion.

And without the community of Judges looking
perenially over your shoulder, it was all too
easy to forget that.  All too tempting to
follow older rules etched into the brain by
long millenia of humans living in much more
primitive societies.


Chapter 7

"So," said Verrens, "she pronounces a formal
Judgment."

"Wait a moment," said Adams, "I'm not there yet."
He read for a short while.  "Yes, a standard
solution to a standard moral problem.  The aside
about modern Human civilization is good, and
explains well the rationale for our system."

Verrens nodded, then, "I somewhat expected her
first Judgment would be more, I don't know,
maybe more flashy, not just some standard
solution."  He paused.  "Although I admit that I
feel relieved that this was her first Judgment.
I hope my first Judgment would be as simple
and straightforward as that."

"I agree," said Adams.  "Simplicity, as the
Scientists continually say, is the core of
scientific beauty.  A common mistake that the
Reporters commit; they like scientific
controversies too much, thinking that
controversy is of interest, and simple,
straightforward, and classic solutions are
boring."  He smiled.  "I'll give you a hint,
if you're shooting for high rank: look for
Judges who are too concerned with what the
Reporters say; they often commit the mistake
of thinking that exceptions to the standard
solutions should occur more often than
'almost never'.  Simplicity is the core of
moral beauty, too.  Of course, as simple as
possible, but no simpler...."

Adams closed his eyes for a moment.  "As to
amateurs - well, I am an amateur Sensei,
and an amateur Scientist; they go well
together.  Rationality is guided by science,
and science is driven by rationality.  The
world still moves; boats, like the one our
heroes are in, still displace an amount of
water whose weight equals their own weight;
Newton's laws are still accurate, to the
extent that General Relativity predicts
them to be accurate.  Non-controversial
issues that I find of great interest and
satisfaction, as an amateur."

Nobody said anything for a moment.

Adams opened his eyes and said, "As to the
novel as written - Judge, have you considered
if the fallacy of legalism applies to its
expression of morality?"

Verrens considered this.  "I did not, Judge.
However, I don't think the charge of legalism
applies.  The fallacy of legalism is the
assumption that law defines morality, rather
than the Central Dogma that morality defines
law.  Our civilization's standard solutions to
problems are not law per se, not even unwritten
laws, as classically cultural customs have been.
The standard solutions are principles that many of
our predecessors have evaluated, over and over,
and in the absence of strong evidence to the
contrary, can generally be safely considered as
correct.  Democracy may not work for a populace
kept ignorant by its media, but beyond that known
failure mode, and others I don't remember out of
hand, democracy works."

Adams smiled, and said, "Shall we continue?"


Chapter 8

Julia found a medical kit stashed away in some
recess of the lifeboat; aside from the standard
first aid equipment, there was a somewhat large
bottle of sunblock which Katja insisted everyone
apply a fixed amount of, in specific locations
of their body.  She then poured a measured
amount of shark repellent into the ocean; Nicole
noted that it was really a combined
shark-and-jellyfish repellent, which made sense.

There were some energy bars, which Katja
declared she would ration out each morning until
rescue; everyone had one for breakfast.

Julia rooted around the raft for a moment,
mumbling something about trying to build a roof
when asked, but eventually just sat, looking
dissatisfied.  Katja recommended that everyone
rest, offering some low-grade tranquilizer pills
from the medical kit; no one took up her offer,
so after taking an expert look over each of them
for serious injuries, and bandaging a scratch on
Raphael's upper arm, Katja popped one of the
pills herself and was soon dozing lightly,
unconcerned and relaxed, on her face a small
smile.

After a while, Julia sat herself comfortably,
her face near Michael's, engaged in a whispered
conversation; Nicole felt a pang of jealousy,
but shrugged it off.  Julia had pulled Michael
in, anyway; perhaps it was appropriate to give
her first chance at him....

Raphael was looking out over the sea; he
seemed sad, Nicole noted.

Demisavants - in earlier ages known as "shy,
but bright", or High IQ Attention Deficit
Disorder, or Asperger's Savant Syndrome - were
now trained, as early as they could be
identified, to explicitly handle social
interaction, and encourage it as one of their
inevitable hobbies.  Many became obessively
brilliant Sociology Scientists as a result of
that training.  Still, the failure of the
built-in cognitive empathy cores in their
brains sometimes showed; Nicole was looking at
one result.  Julia was avoiding looking at
Raphael, a classic case of an intact affective
empathy showing to a demisavant, too late,
what her impaired cognitive empathy could not
earlier predict; an old, reliable sign of
demisavanthood.

At least demisavants could operate well in
modern society, with training.  The opposite
psychosis - antisocial personality disorder,
with an intact cognitive empathy but impaired
affective empathy - was still dangerous.

Nicole said to Raphael -

- was about to speak to Raphael -

Raphael jumped into the ocean, and began swimming
away!

Some well-trained part of Nicole took over.

"Executor!  I am Judge Nicole Angel!  Formally,
I ask you to pursue and subdue that individual!"

Michael pushed himself away from the boat;
Raphael had jumped off the side opposite to him.
Julia covered her mouth in pain; some swift
movement of Michael's had hit her accidentally.
He swam around the boat, then started in pursuit
of Raphael.

Raphael was a surprisingly strong swimmer, even
with a lifevest encumbering him.  Michael could
barely keep up; after a minute or so, he paused
to pull off his own lifevest and redoubled his
efforts.

They were almost distant specks when Michael
finally reached Raphael.  Perhaps a minute had
passed; they were strong swimmers.

"Engineer.  Julia.  I am the Judge.  Can we
navigate the boat towards them?"  Michael did
not appear to be heading back; perhaps all his
effort was in subduing Raphael.

"Not very effectively, Judge.  The boat is round,
not a very hydrodynamic shape.  We don't have
paddles.  A lifeboat isn't exactly meant for
travel..." Julia paused.  "Take off your
lifevests.  Their backs are relatively flat and
stiff.  Not the best paddles, but better than
hands."

The three women paddled with their improvised
paddles.  After a while, Katja gave up trying to
use her lifevest as a paddle; the lifevest
floated and couldn't cut water very well, so she
used her hands instead.  Julia and Nicole
persevered; Nicole could feel her hands grow raw
where the lifevest chafed, as she fought to push
it under the water, to use it as a larger paddle
than her hands.

Perhaps an hour or more later they were near
enough for Katja to pull the two towards them.
Michael had his arms wrapped around Raphael.
Both were panting deeply, Raphael still
struggling.

All of them were exhausted, so they just pulled
the two men close to their boat, all three of
them holding the pair.  They waited, catching
their breath.

Michael spoke first, a melodious but
authoritative voice.  "Madam Judge, " he said,
"as per your formal request, I have apprehended
a certain Raphael Yu.  I formally ask proof of
vocation as Judge, and formal reason for
pursuit and apprehension."  He chuckled.
"Okay, that's probably not something I'll get
right now."

The three women laughed a little.  Julia said,
"Ah, and now you have to formally date me, you
stole my first kiss!"  Julia spoke giddily.
"And I didn't even get the honor of kissing
by mouth as a first kiss.  All I got was the
back of your hand!  Give back the kiss you
stole from me!"  She laughed heartily.

The rest were nonplussed for a moment.  Katja
looked at Julia, then at Michael, who appeared
both puzzled and mortified.  Then Katja
started laughing too, which made Nicole and
even Michael laugh.  Demisavant, indeed.

Then Julia said, "Although somewhat more
seriously, Judge, what do we do about Raphael?
We lost a lifevest, although we do have one
spare here," indicating the stash from which
the medical kit had been.

Nicole stared at her.

Raphael had defied a decision that they had all
agreed to be bound to.  A precommitment to a
method, specified by a Judge.  The timing to be
determined by an Engineer's expert decision on
the continued seaworthiness of their craft.
Both had been defied, without starting a
disputation arena in which a precommitment
could be modified, if new evidence showed that
the agreed-upon precommitment would be
irrational.

A punishment was necessary, but -


Chapter 9

Verrens waited as Judge David Adams finished
reading the chapter.

"A punishment," said Adams at last, "so soon.
Would you agree to this, Judge Verrens?"

"Yes," Verrens said without hesitation, "As the
novel implies that they had all precommitted to
the method and timing.  As a social species
Humanity must punish non-cooperation.  Of course,
the precommitment was not explicitly shown, but
it would be disingenious of the author to expect
the reader to assume otherwise."

"True," said Adams.  He looked at Verrens
expectantly.

Verrens considered for a moment.  "Akrasia, the
state of acting against one's better judgment. I
wonder if this is what caused non-cooperation
from Raphael?"

"Probably not," answered Adams.  "Strictly
speaking, akrasia can only occur due to the
overutilization of a human being's limited
willpower.  If you've already done a good deed,
then you are likely not to do a good deed
again within a short period of time, as
experimenters in the early twenty-first century
found.  It is even worse if it is a deed that
appears good, but is inefficient and does not
actually end up giving actual benefit to
anyone; then, a person's willpower is consumed
needlessly with no lasting effect.  Many
messages circulated back then, asking readers
to pass them on, so that people would know
about evil events occurring; but such messages
actually prevented people from doing any real
good, other than to pass them on.  The end effect
was letting those evils continue.  The wider they
spread, the greater the harm they did; hence
their widespread illegality in our enlightened
era.  For Raphael to suffer akrasia, he must
have done some earlier good that sapped his
will -"

"Precisely, Lord Judge," said Verrens.  "He was
insulted by Julia; inadvertently, as she is
characterized as being a demisavant, but the
event still occurred.  A classic case of a noisy
prisoner's dilemma.  He had overlooked that
insult -"

"- and considered it a good deed, which sapped
his willpower, setting him up for
non-cooperation later.  Or in this chapter,
rather.  Why, that is a good insight, Judge.
I would have said that Raphael was never
portrayed as doing any good deed; as not
having done any deed, as yet."

"Thank you, Judge."

Adams continued.  "So far, the women have
been more proactive than the men; Julia is
currently the motivating driver of Nicole,
who is an active protaganist that has made a
Judgment that binds the precommitment of her
microcosmic society.  Katja has shown
expertise in her vocation.  In contrast the
men have been passive, before Raphael's
non-cooperation, with Raphael a patient under
Katja's care."

Adams paused.  "Well, as a Judge myself I
would say that Raphael deserves punishment,
but -"


Chapter 10

- was punishment feasible?

Nicole had to think about it.  Hard.

Raphael could not be left in the water, as he
would be in a better position to attempt a
foolhardy self-sacrifice again.  Restraining
him was taking all of Michael's strength,
although -

"If the Executor lets you go," Nicole said to
Raphael, "will you act as a sane and
cooperative human?"

"Yes," Raphael said.

Nicole nodded.  "You may release him,
Executor.  Thank you, Michael."

Could social constraint - shame,
essentially - bind him strongly enough that
physical restraints would be unnecessary?
Nicole hoped so; she didn't want any of their
physical materials used to build some sort of
physical restraint, or take up too much of
Julia's time and attention.  By the same
token, she didn't want Michael spending all
his time guarding Raphael.

Well, assuming shame would keep him
restrained - what punishment could Nicole
impose on Raphael?

Wait - how did Nicole know what she knew?

She had been running on instinct - on an
automated System 1 process that had reacted
and judged.  Now she engaged her deliberative
System 2, to work over the decision of her
trained System 1; a microcosm of the community
of Judges, one brain system overseeing the
decisions of another.

Was punishment appropriate in this case?  Had
her instinct failed her?

Consider the consequences.  Punishment of the
non-cooperator would require significant
resources of their little group; at the very
least, it would require Nicole's willpower
to find some punishment that would fit their
constrained resources, which could risk
akrasia in the near term for her.

Non-punishment of the non-cooperator would
signal the de facto repudiation of their
precommitment, without even any disputation
arena to contest it.  It would undermine the
authority of the Judge to pass Judgment over
the moral decisions in their community.

She was a Judge; but duty did not - or rather,
should not - factor into her decision.
Deontology - the ethical theory that right was
what was defined as a person's obligations -
was considered, by a majority faction of
Judges, a failed model for morality.
Pragmatic consequentialism - the ethical
theory that the consequences of actions, based
on a precommitted set of values, subject to
scientific research, determined what was
right - was, for all its flaws and
limitations, considered by the majority of
Judges as the best ethical theory; a way to
keep growing less and less wrong, but
(possibly) never completely right.

Would it be right to punish Raphael?

How could they trust him again, if he was not
punished?  At least punishment would, in the
minds of the members of their tiny community,
balance the books and allow them to treat
Raphael as an equal once more, when his
punishment was served.  It would deter
everyone from performing similar, possibly
wasteful acts of "heroism" and self-serving
"self-sacrifice".  At least, that was what it
should be, if all of them had at least basic
rationality training.

How could they trust him again, if he was
punished?  A person marked as "non-cooperator"
may have that mark almost permanently against
him or her, in the community; it would stymie
his or her future attempts at cooperation.
That could happen, especially in a stressful
situation, where rationality training could
fail, where the built-in animal instincts
stood closer than ever.

Nicole kept thinking, aware that everyone on
the boat was waiting for her decision.

"Give me three minutes to think," Nicole said.
"Engineer.  Julia, I assume you have a timer
of some sort?"

"Yes, Judge Nicole Angel," Julia said,
indicating her wristwatch.  She set an alarm.

The time was on -


Chapter 11

"Ah," Adams said at last, upon finishing the
chapter, "luminosity.  The act of reflecting,
explicitly, one's attention upon one's own
thought processes, investigating whether they
should be changed."  He looked at Verrens
expectantly.

Verrens was trained in the basic rationality
training required of all citizens, and in the
intermediate rationality training required of
all Judge trainees; he could not remember a
topic called 'luminosity' -

"You don't know?" said Adams.  "Well, I've
been advocating its movement into the
intermediate stages of rationality training,
once I learned about it in my amateur Sensei
rationality studies.  At least for Judges.
Perhaps Nicole is being portrayed as being
amateur Sensei.  Or it could be an impulsive
luminosity, not a deliberately decided one.
Don't worry, your lack of knowledge of
luminosity is not a point against you; it's
not yet a standard topic for the rationality
dojos at the intermediate levels that Judges
are required to take.  Although in any case,
some rationality Senseis claim that
luminosity should be derivable by any
sufficiently bright rationalityka; a view
I don't agree with."

Adams continued.  "These rationality
senseis claim that dual process theory
makes luminosity obvious.  That the
deliberative System 2 processes are quite
capable of shining brightly on the automated
System 1 processes.  Thus, luminosity.  But
the full luminosity topic is not just about
System 2 investigating System 1, but also
System 2 investigating itself."

Verrens could only nod, taking in the
lecture.

"But enough of that," said Adams finally.
"What do you think about punishing Raphael,
now?"

"Well, Judge," said Verrens, "I'm not so
certain about it now, now that I've
thought more deeply about their situation
and their current lack of resources to
effectively punish Raphael, the current
stresses in their situation, et cetera.
Perhaps I should also ask the same boon
Nicole asked for - three minutes to think."

They both chuckled at this.

"Well, Judge Verrens," said Adams, "my
experience still says that Raphael should
be punished, and that punishment is in fact
feasible.  Although it does require a more
complex scheme for punishment, which Nicole
must spend her attention for.  In real life,
she could probably afford to spend that
attention, although the situation in this
novel suggests that she must ration this
resource.  In any case, I'll grant you your
three minutes -"
