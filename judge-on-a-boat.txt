Judge on a Boat


Prologue

Falling, falling, falling, that was what was happening,
of course falling was what a planetary drop pod was
for but this was the bad falling, the kind which could
kill you, and her brain - a primitive simian derivative
that processed "falling" extremely well, falling being
a work-related risk for swinging around on trees - was
putting out distress codes, feeding nasty hormones into
her bloodstream, which really necessitated triggering
her deep rationality training, but she didn't really
remember to do that part.

But she survived, and in the end, that was what a brain
was for.

Rationality was for winning.  And perhaps in retrospect
the flight-or-fight response had been the right thing to
do, at least she survived...

Although in retrospect, maybe she should have forked over
the added price for the safer space elevator.


Chapter 1

Emmanuel Verrens woke with a start when Judge David Adams'
receptionist spoke his name, indicating that his meeting
with the august Fifth-rank Lord Judge was to start.

Emmanuel Verrens was a young Judge, of the interplanetary
order of Judges.  As yet unranked, his status newly minted
with his recent examination.

He had been summoned for a meeting, topic unspecified except
for a vague "regarding your examination and recent promotion
to unranked Judge", and his rationality training suggested
that this summons, so recently after his examination and
promotion, was not good.  It was less good, too, that now
he had arrived at the appointed time, he had been asked to
wait, and was still waiting almost an hour later.

Still, there was insufficient evidence that it was something
specifically to fear, and so Verrens had
clamped down on his misgivings, invoking some of the
standard rationality forms developed against fear.  Don't
fear failure.  Mantras to be repeated as a background thought
loop, to keep the fear at bay, deeply ingrained training that
was easy to maintain.  Special thought processes designed
and refined to keep himself sane against fear.  It was easy,
the little fear was no big deal, and thus Verrens was quite
sane, even as his appointed time came and went, and he was
still in the waiting room.

He'd even managed to nap a little, out of sheer boredom, that
was how little the fear got through his trained defenses
against it.

Verrens got up, nodded, and entered the office of Judge
David Adams.


Chapter 2

Nicole Angel awoke to a blissful, swaying feeling, found her
hand clutched tight to some rubber, or probably synthetic
plastic, and saw the ocean surrounding her.

Memory came flooding back.

She had been on the way to her standardized Judgment Acceptance
examination, back on Old Earth, from her birthplace at Mars
Lagrange 1.  The trip was costly, involving an actual drop into and
(of course) liftoff from a planetary gravity well, and Earth was
still the heaviest gravity well inhabited by humans, and was
still the cultural center of Humanity, which meant that the trip
was quite expensive.

But passing the standard test and becoming a Judge was supposed
to be worth that, and more.

She'd crammed - rationality senseis clucked at students who did
so, but that attractor state (defer things later! You Ain't Gonna
Need It!) still attracted human beings like flies to honey, or
more likely vinegar, but as irrationalities went cramming was a
just a slight inefficiency, so rationality senseis just clucked
at it - and of course like many she even dipped a little into
the Dark Arts, using rote memorization instead of actual
understanding.  Then she kissed her family goodbye, promising to
come back a fully-fledged Judge Of No Rank.

The actual trip through space was uneventful - her seat companion
was a young female Engineer, sponsored by her home company for
training at Earth, and somewhere nearby, Nicole had noticed,
had been a somewhat attractive young male whose bearing suggested
"Executor", with whom Nicole had kept slight eye contact a few
seconds more than strictly uninterested strangerness warranted.

Then came the failed drop, and now this, floating somehow on an
inflatable raft with two strangers and a slightly-more-familiar
acquaintance, her Engineer seat companion of the company Earth
training trip.

No, make that two strangers, her Engineer acquaintance, and that
somewhat attractive maybe Executor with whom Nicole had maybe
flirted, hanging off the other side of the raft, his chest and
head inside, but his lower torso and legs dipped into the ocean.

A total of five people.

The Engineer tapped her shoulder, and then whispered, "Judge,
we have a problem.  This raft's capacity is four people."


Chapter 3

"Good Afternoon, Judge Adams," he said.

"Good Afternoon.  Have a seat," answered Adams.

It wasn't a personal office, as it turned out.  Or if it was,
then it was a rather strange one.  Had Verrens been asked his
opinion, it was actually a meeting room, with a long table,
several chairs, a whiteboard, and a screen.

Judge David Adams, of Fifth Rank, sat near one end, with several
printed papers lying spread out in front of him.  Adams was
indicating a seat just across his, so Verrens sat into it.
There was silence for a moment, and then -

"Here," said Adams, handing over a few papers, "is a manuscript -
ostensibly of a novel - regarding a Judge, or rather, an aspiring
Judge trainee.  As you yourself was, just recently, prior to
your own examination here on Earth.  Think of it as an informal
final examination for yourself."

Verrens took the papers.  Was Adams pulling rank and trying to
make him some kind of early proofreader for his own novel?

It started, "Falling, falling, falling, that was what was
happening, of course falling was what a planetary drop pod
was for but this was the bad falling..."

Verrens asked, "Judge, what is this for?"

"It's being proposed as a form of training, and potentially
testing, for student Judges.  Informally, you are here since,
until recently, you were a student Judge, and thus we would
value your input about this manuscript," said Adams.

"I see," said Verrens, ruffling some pages.  "Out of
curiousity, is this based on, say, a true story?"

"You could say that," said Adams.  "So true, in fact, that
we can even trace the thoughts of the main character."

"Ah," was all Verrens could say.

He read for a moment.

"Ah," said Adams, "I see you have had speed reader training,
Judge.  That is fortunate.  Perhaps we can complete our
analysis of this novel in one sitting."

"Yes, Judge," said Verrens.  "I studied it fully.  Speed
up saccades, eliminate subvocalization, lengthen
fixations, and practice, practice, practice..."

"That's good," answered Adams.  "I myself am just starting
speed reading training.  And just in time too, since I
must read many more of these novels, of various authorships
and variations in version.  And interview many different
new Judges like yourself, in order to gain different views
on the novel."


Chapter 4

"I'm not a Judge!" Nicole whispered back urgently.  "I'm
just a candidate for -"

"Well, you're the nearest thing to a Judge we have right
now," the Engineer answered back just as urgently.  "I
asked.  The other woman is a Medic, the man in the boat
is an accountant, and the man hanging onto our boat for
dear life is an Executor.  You're the nearest to a Judge
we have right now.  So.  I'm asking you, formally, for a
Judgment, on a matter of life and death.  How should we
choose who to kick off this boat, Judge?  There's five of
us, the boat holds four, and -"

"Can't this boat really hold five?  Especially with one of
those five being technically outside the boat anyway?"
There were safety margins, weren't there?  Surely an
Engineer would know that -

"Normally it can," said the Engineer.  "That's why I
pulled the Executor close.  I couldn't pull him all the
way in, I'm not physically strong enough, especially
last night, and he's a heavy guy.  But the boat seems
to have a slow leak -"

"All right, how about if we all do what the Executor
is doing?  Hang off the side of the boat?"

The Engineer paused.

"Plausible," she said.  "But Judge, consider - currently
with only one extra passenger hanging off the side of
the boat, we're already experiencing a slow leak.  We
could all hang off the side of the boat, but what if
that doesn't stop the leaking?  That's highly likely,
too.  If we're not rescued soon, we may have to sacrifice
one of us so that the raft doesn't sink completely.  It's
a metal lined rubber craft, so below a certain air
pressure in the bladder it will sink.  Now I'm asking
you, formally, for a Judgment, on a matter of life and
death.  In the future, we may need to kick off one of our
number.  How should we choose who to kick off this boat,
Judge?  Let this be a precommitment to a method, specified
by a Judge, that binds us all."

But Nicole wasn't a Judge.

It didn't even matter that she hadn't passed, or even
taken, the Judge Acceptance Exam.  She knew she had the
knowledge and the training, and if she had taken it, the
chances were good that she would pass and be promoted to
an unranked Judge.

But passing a test did not make you a Judge, not really.

It was rather than community and culture of the Judges
that defined your identity as a Judge.

Oh, the test was thorough.  Written exams, and even
scanning of your brain's morality cores, at least those
already identified by Neurology Scientists.  Practice
mock tests, even - the Sociology Scientists were paid
handsomely to think up of new tests each year that
would look innocuous to even the most high-strung
Judge examinee, but which would reveal the inner
workings of their morality cores almost as well as, or
(it was reputed) even better than the Neurologist's
best scans.

And once you passed, the eyes of every other living
Judge were upon you and every moral decision over
which you passed Judgment...

Cameras were ubiquitous all over Humanity's inhabited
areas.  By law, all cameras were to be marked and
readily visible as such, and all were accessible to
the public.  Spy cameras, unmarked and hidden, or
accessible only to certain groups or individuals,
were highly illegal and always searched for by the
Hackers; the Sousveillance Law that banned hidden
cameras and required public access was the only
existing law that crossed geopolitical boundaries,
and the only one allowed to mention the death
penalty as a possible punishment.

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?  Why, every watcher
was watched by fellow watchers, and every person
capable of minimum reason - and this category was
very broad indeed - was a watcher.

And every Judge was judged by every other Judge.

A Judge gained rank by a Formal Challenge of
another Judge's Judgment.  Such a Formal
Challenge of Judgment was an assertion that the
Judgment had been faulty.  Records of the decision,
as well as the particular details of the issue to
be decided, were often available from the
ubiquitous cameras all over inhabited space.

And once such a case was brought to light, Judges
all over Humanity's domain were invited to vote
on whether to strip a rank from challenger, or
from the challenged.  The stripped rank would be
awarded to the other.

A Judge of No Rank would lose his or her vocation,
if he or she lost a Formal Challenge of Judgment.
Slightly more than half the Judges in existence at
any one time would be of No Rank.  The other
remaining half were composed almost entirely of
First Rank.  A very few achieved higher ranks.

Rank was a score, but by law Judges were paid
based on age and typical living expenses in their
registered living area.  But a higher rank still
meant that you had a safety margin, in case of an
error in Judgment.

And without that community of Judges watching over
your shoulder, you couldn't be a Judge, not
really.  With the respect accorded to Judges in
Humanity's culture, and the built-in selfishness
circuits of your simian-derived brain, you could
only be a tyrant.

There were no cameras on the boat.  So, barring
illegal unmarked cameras, no one could ever see
the details of Nicole's Judgment.


Chapter 5

Emmanuel Verrens paused.

If the novel was about true events - how had they
known about Nicole, without any cameras having
seen it?

"Judge Adams?"

"Yes, Judge Verrens?" Adams asked.

"Judge, if there were no cameras on the boat,
and this novel is non-fictional -"

"Well, I didn't really say the novel is
non-fictional, or even say that it was based
on true events.  I did say, that you could say
it was based on true events, but really, the
truth of these events is a bit hazy, as you
should recognize from the lack of cameras."

"Ah," said Verrens, "I see, Judge."

"Do you?  Good," said Adams.  He smiled.
"In any case, suffice it to say that nothing
illegal was involved in the writing of this
novel.  Rather, I wish you to focus on the
moral dilemmas that the protagonist is facing.
What exactly are they, at this point?"

Verrens considered for a while, skimming
through the earlier pages before he had
inserted his finger.

"Well, there's the obvious one asked of her -
the method by which to select one of their
number to kick off the boat.  The fact that
she is being asked to make a Judgment, even
though she is not yet a Judge -"

"That one is trivially dismissable, I would
say, Judge?" said Adams, interrupting Verrens.

"True," Verrens said.  "She has the training,
and the confidence in her skill to act as a
full Judge, despite not having taken the
test yet.  As I was about to mention, anyway.
Not really a moral dilemma, then, although I
included it for completeness.  She can indeed
act as a full Judge - awareness of one's
knowledge and level of skill is a requirement
in our vocation.  And the final dilemma -"

Adams looked at him expectantly.

"The lack of peer oversight," Verrens said,
"set against the necessity of providing
Judgment, in a condition where such Judgment is
likely to be necessary, and likely to be a
matter of life and death."

Adams continued to look at him expectantly.

"I'm sorry, Judge, those are all the dilemmas
I can see right now," Verrens said.

Adams nodded.  "Judge, both you and Nicole
Angel failed to see another moral dilemma,
at this point."  He paused.  "She did not
consider investigating for herself whether
what the Engineer told her was true, versus
her personal embarrasment, should it indeed
turn out to be true.  A common logical
failing that afflicts even the best of us,
and as I recall, three of my successful
Formal Challenges."

Verrens considered this.  "But Judge, the
exposition of the Engineer -"

"- was not sufficient evidence of its truth.
Of course, I must admit that it would be so,
in a typical novel; a writer preserves detail,
so as not to overburden the reader with possible
red herrings.  But in the world, the real
world, a Judge in such a position must
demand the investigation; must at least do
so as background to his or her task."

Verrens nodded.  "And if this is, as you say,
true in a way - then perhaps that is a true
moral failing of Nicole Adams."

"One she would do well to protect herself
against, in her future career.  Of course,
the novel is yet to reveal whether that will
happen, or even possible to happen, or -"


Chapter 6
