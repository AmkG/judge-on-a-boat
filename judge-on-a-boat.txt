Judge on a Boat


Prologue

Falling, falling, falling, that was what was happening,
of course falling was what a planetary drop pod was
for but this was the bad falling, the kind which could
kill you, and her brain - a primitive simian derivative
that processed "falling" extremely well, falling being
a work-related risk for swinging around on trees - was
putting out distress codes, feeding nasty hormones into
her bloodstream, which really necessitated triggering
her deep rationality training, but she didn't really
remember to do that part.

But she survived, and in the end, that was what a brain
was for.

Rationality was for winning.  And perhaps in retrospect
the flight-or-fight response had been the right thing to
do, at least she survived...

Although in retrospect, maybe she should have forked over
the added price for the safer space elevator.


Chapter 1

Emmanuel Verrens woke with a start when Judge David Adams'
receptionist spoke his name, indicating that his meeting
with the august Fifth-rank Lord Judge was to start.

Emmanuel Verrens was a young Judge, of the interplanetary
order of Judges.  As yet unranked, his status newly minted
with his recent examination.

He had been summoned for a meeting, topic unspecified except
for a vague "regarding your examination and recent promotion
to unranked Judge", and his rationality training suggested
that this summons, so recently after his examination and
promotion, was not good.  It was less good, too, that now
he had arrived at the appointed time, he had been asked to
wait, and was still waiting almost an hour later.

Still, there was insufficient evidence that it was something
specifically to fear, and so Verrens had
clamped down on his misgivings, invoking some of the
standard rationality forms developed against fear.  Don't
fear failure.  Mantras to be repeated as a background thought
loop, to keep the fear at bay, deeply ingrained training that
was easy to maintain.  Special thought processes designed
and refined to keep himself sane against fear.  It was easy,
the little fear was no big deal, and thus Verrens was quite
sane, even as his appointed time came and went, and he was
still in the waiting room.

He'd even managed to nap a little, out of sheer boredom, that
was how little the fear got through his trained defenses
against it.

Verrens got up, nodded, and entered the office of Judge
David Adams.


Chapter 2

Nicole Angel awoke to a blissful, swaying feeling, found her
hand clutched tight to some rubber, or probably synthetic
plastic, and saw the ocean surrounding her.

Memory came flooding back.

She had been on the way to her standardized Judgment Acceptance
examination, back on Old Earth, from her birthplace at Mars
Lagrange 1.  The trip was costly, involving an actual drop into and
(of course) liftoff from a planetary gravity well, and Earth was
still the heaviest gravity well inhabited by humans, and was
still the cultural center of Humanity, which meant that the trip
was quite expensive.

But passing the standard test and becoming a Judge was supposed
to be worth that, and more.

She'd crammed - rationality senseis clucked at students who did
so, but that attractor state (defer things later! You Ain't Gonna
Need It!) still attracted human beings like flies to honey, or
more likely vinegar, but as irrationalities went cramming was a
just a slight inefficiency, so rationality senseis just clucked
at it - and of course like many she even dipped a little into
the Dark Arts, using rote memorization instead of actual
understanding.  Then she kissed her family goodbye, promising to
come back a fully-fledged Judge Of No Rank.

The actual trip through space was uneventful - her seat companion
was a young female Engineer, sponsored by her home company for
training at Earth, and somewhere nearby, Nicole had noticed,
had been a somewhat attractive young male whose bearing suggested
"Executor", with whom Nicole had kept slight eye contact a few
seconds more than strictly uninterested strangerness warranted.

Then came the failed drop, and now this, floating somehow on an
inflatable raft with two strangers and a slightly-more-familiar
acquaintance, her Engineer seat companion of the company Earth
training trip.

No, make that two strangers, her Engineer acquaintance, and that
somewhat attractive maybe Executor with whom Nicole had maybe
flirted, hanging off the other side of the raft, his chest and
head inside, but his lower torso and legs dipped into the ocean.

A total of five people.

The Engineer tapped her shoulder, and then whispered, "Judge,
we have a problem.  This raft's capacity is four people."


Chapter 3

"Good Afternoon, Judge Adams," he said.

"Good Afternoon.  Have a seat," answered Adams.

It wasn't a personal office, as it turned out.  Or if it was,
then it was a rather strange one.  Had Verrens been asked his
opinion, it was actually a meeting room, with a long table,
several chairs, a whiteboard, and a screen.

Judge David Adams, of Fifth Rank, sat near one end, with several
printed papers lying spread out in front of him.  Adams was
indicating a seat just across his, so Verrens sat into it.
There was silence for a moment, and then -

"Here," said Adams, handing over a few papers, "is a manuscript -
ostensibly of a novel - regarding a Judge, or rather, an aspiring
Judge trainee.  As you yourself was, just recently, prior to
your own examination here on Earth.  Think of it as an informal
final examination for yourself."

Verrens took the papers.  Was Adams pulling rank and trying to
make him some kind of early proofreader for his own novel?

It started, "Falling, falling, falling, that was what was
happening, of course falling was what a planetary drop pod
was for but this was the bad falling..."

Verrens asked, "Judge, what is this for?"

"It's being proposed as a form of training, and potentially
testing, for student Judges.  Informally, you are here since,
until recently, you were a student Judge, and thus we would
value your input about this manuscript," said Adams.

"I see," said Verrens, ruffling some pages.  "Out of
curiousity, is this based on, say, a true story?"

"You could say that," said Adams.  "So true, in fact, that
we can even trace the thoughts of the main character."

"Ah," was all Verrens could say.

He read for a moment.

"Ah," said Adams, "I see you have had speed reader training,
Judge.  That is fortunate.  Perhaps we can complete our
analysis of this novel in one sitting."

"Yes, Judge," said Verrens.  "I studied it fully.  Speed
up saccades, eliminate subvocalization, lengthen
fixations, and practice, practice, practice..."

"That's good," answered Adams.  "I myself am just starting
speed reading training.  And just in time too, since I
must read many more of these novels, of various authorships
and variations in version.  And interview many different
new Judges like yourself, in order to gain different views
on the novel."


Chapter 4

"I'm not a Judge!" Nicole whispered back urgently.  "I'm
just a candidate for -"

"Well, you're the nearest to a Judge we have right now,"
the Engineer answered back just as urgently.  "I asked.
The other woman is an administrator, the man in the boat
is an accountant, and the man hanging onto our boat for
dear life is an Executor.  You're the nearest to a Judge
we have right now.  So.  I'm asking you, formally, for a
Judgment, on a matter of life and death.  How should we
choose who to kick off this boat, Judge?  There's five of
us, the boat holds four, and -"

"Can't this boat really hold five?  Especially with one of
those five being technically outside the boat anyway?"
There were safety margins, weren't there?  Surely an
Engineer would know that -

"Normally it can," said the Engineer.  "That's why I
pulled the Executor close.  I couldn't pull him all the
way in, I'm not physically strong enough, especially
last night, and he's a heavy guy.  But the boat seems
to have a slow leak -"

"All right, how about if we all do what the Executor
is doing?  Hang off the side of the boat?"
